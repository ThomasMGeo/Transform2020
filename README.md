# Transform2020

This is for [Transform 2020](https://transform2020.sched.com/), a fully online geoscience conference. The notebook (only 1) will be covering basic python syntax, packages, and basic subsurface workflows using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, [Lasio](https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio), and [Striplog](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/striplog). 

Instructions/Installation for use with [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb):

1. Make a google account, if you have a gmail, you have one! (free will work fine, no need for Colab Pro)
2. Download the t20-intro folder from this repository (green button in the upper right) and drop folder into Google drive (you will have to unzip it). Short gif [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5gde0jgxvclv7bn/github.gif?dl=0)
3. Install Google Colab in Google Drive (search Colaboratory in connected apps) Short gif [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nns9lq5se10fshx/colab_install.gif?dl=0)
4. This needs to be in the browser google drive, not the local folder on your hard drive.
