# Transform2020

This is for [Transform 2020](https://transform2020.sched.com/), a fully online geoscience conference. The notebook (only 1) will be covering basic python syntax, packages, and basic subsurface workflows using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, [lasio](https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio), and [striplog](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/striplog). 

Instructions/Installation for use with [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb):

1. Make a google account, if you have a gmail, you have one! (free will work fine, no need for Colab Pro).
2. Download the t20-intro folder from this repository (green button in the upper right) and drop the t20-intro folder into Google drive (you will have to unzip it). Short gif [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5gde0jgxvclv7bn/github.gif?dl=0).
3. Install Google Colab in Google Drive (search Colaboratory in connected apps) Short gif [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nns9lq5se10fshx/colab_install.gif?dl=0).
4. This needs to be in the browser google drive, not the local folder on your hard drive.
5. Right click on the .ipynb file to open with Google Colab.
6. Run and enjoy!
